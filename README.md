# Color-blindness-test

The Color Blindness Test App is a Python-based application designed to help users identify color blindness by presenting them with a series of color-related tasks. Color blindness, also known as color vision deficiency, is a condition that affects an individual's ability to perceive colors accurately. This application aims to provide a simple and accessible tool for users to self-assess their color vision.

Features:

    1. Generates color-related tasks using randomly selected colors.
    2. Displays circles filled with different colors and prompts users to identify the colors.
    3. Provides feedback on user responses and indicates whether they have correctly identified the colors.
    4. Includes a user-friendly interface with instructions for operating the app.
    5. Allows users to exit the app at any time by pressing a designated key ('x').

Dependencies:

    Python 3.10
    OpenCV (cv2)
    NumPy

Usage:

    - Clone the repository to your local machine.
    - Ensure that Python and the required dependencies are installed.
    - Run the main Python script (main.py) to start the application.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the color blindness test.
    - Press the 'x' key to exit the application at any time.
